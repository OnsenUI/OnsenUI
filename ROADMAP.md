ROADMAP
====

v1.2.3
----

 * Side menu (combination of Sliding Menu and Split view). This component will be useful for apps that run on both small and large screens.
 * Animations for Modal.
 * e2e tests using Protactor.
 * Rethink `<ons-dialog>` so it can be used better in AngularJS.
 * `$onsModal` service that maintains a counter and gives z-index values for elements. Used by `<ons-alert-dialog>`, `<ons-dialog>`, `<ons-modal>` and `<ons-popover>` so they all share same modal mask.

v1.3.0
----

 * Windows Phone support (?)
 * Google Material Design (?)
