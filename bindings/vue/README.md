With Onsen UI you can create beautiful and performant hybrid apps that run on both Android and iOS. This package contains Vue.js bindings and components that makes it easy to integrate the Onsen UI components in Vue.js apps.

npm run dev
```

This will open a development server with a kitchen sink app with several examples.
